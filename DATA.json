A leading Indian industrialist in a recent article on ways to strengthen India's economy has drawn attention to the problems of inflation and industrial sickness among other things. One of the main reasons for industrial sickness in our country has been the fact that business and industrial managers have not been able to look beyond the immediate future. They have been too preoccupied with their attempts to report favourable results for the current year, higher profits and larger dividends to the shareholders. The planning horizon has hardly ever exceeded five years. Investments have been inadequate for new plants and towards diversification and expansions. Modernisation and asset creation has seriously lagged behind. In business, growth is needed for survival; one has to grow if one does not want to be wiped out. This is particularly true today with liberalization of imports and increasing competition. Moreover, growth and higher productivity create employment and higher employment creates larger markets both for industrial and consumer products. It was Henry Ford who brought home the need for the creation of a larger and a more stable middle class, that is, a larger number of people who can afford more and more of goods and services. Even after seventy years of independence our industrialists have not been able to shed the petty shop keeper's mentality and our highly educated management has tagged along merrily and without concern.\n\n\n\r\nWhich of the following short comings of Indian industrialists has been highlighted by the author?", "Option A": "They are more concerned for immediate gains than for development activities.", "Option B": "They are reluctant to maintain the shopkeeper mentality.", "Option C": "They are less concerned for payment of dividends to the shareholders.", "Option D": "They invest reasonably high amount on diversification and expansion.", "Option E": "None of these", "Solution": "A"}, {"Question": "Direction: Read the given passage carefully and answer the questions that follow.

Arrange P, Q, R, S between A and B to give its correct sequence. A: In Salmon Rushdie's Haroun and the Sea of Stories, Khattamshud, the enemy of imagination and the ruler of the Land of Chup, tells us what he knows about stifling stories. P: The honour of Gounder women was invoked in a campaign against Perumal Murugan's novel, Mathorubhagan, in Namakkal two years ago. Just recently, the Jharkhand government has banned Hansda Sowvendra Shekhar's the Adivasi Will Not Dance, a collection of stories published in 2015, on the charge that it dishonours Santhal women. In doing so, the government legitimised an old and vicious online campaign by a section of people in Jharkhand - both tribal and non-tribal - which railed at Shekhar for writing \"porn\". The Santhal writer, who is also accused of misrepresenting his own indigenous people, has also been suspended from his job as a government doctor in Pakur. Q: The wise men and women who sit in angry judgement over books have not been known to read before reaching for the gun. Still, it might surprise you to know that the story for which Shekhar was pilloried on Facebook - \"Semen, Saliva, Sweat, Blood\" - was written for a 2012 anthology of erotic stories. It is not even a part of the book that has been banned. It might surprise you further to know that six of the 10 stories in The Adivasi Will Not Dance feature women protagonists, some of them unforgettable characters. R: \"To ruin a happy story, you must make it sad. To ruin an action drama, you must make it move too slowly. To ruin a mystery, you must make the criminal's identity obvious even to the most stupid audience. To ruin a love story, you must turn it into a tale of hate, \"he says. In today's India, where pockets of Chup proliferate everywhere, we could add one more ingredient: To ruin a story, you must turn it into a matter of honour. S: One of the most striking works of Indian fiction in English in recent times, The Adivasi Will Not Dance is not an anthropological study of dancing noble savages. Shekhar would rather tell the story of the inhabitants of a mineral-rich land, left powerless by state and big capital. His characters are flesh-and-blood people, following their desires and compulsions against the indifference of a coal-blackened landscape. B: The year-round celebration of literature and writers might make you think otherwise, but the backlash against Shekhar and Murugan underlines the essential loneliness of the writer, especially who lives away from metropolitan literary salons and networks. When I spoke briefly to Shekhar, on the day his effigy was burnt in Pakur and before the government swung into action, he had just returned from treating patients with dengue haemorrhagic fever in Sangrampur village, 5 km away. \" I am not afraid, and I cannot afford to be afraid,\" he had said.", "Option A": "QSPR", "Option B": "RPQS", "Option C": "RPSQ", "Option D": "QRSP", "Option E": "None of these", "Solution": "B"}, {"Question": "Fill in the blank with correct determiners.

Cambridge University examiners have been asked to stop using words like \"genius\", \"brilliance\" and \"flair\" as these encourage gender inequality. An argument is that words like \"genius\" have a tradition associated with men. Of course sceptics say that Marie Curie too was called a genius - but Curie stands out in a field crammed otherwise with Rembrandts, Newtons and Naipauls. The small number of women called \"brilliant\" could blithely overlook the multiple barriers, from home to the world, that women face. The casual use of a word like \"genius\" could simply imply that, by their sheer preponderance, genius comes naturally to men?and only occasionally to a few good women. In Cambridge, the unthinking use of such terms is a worry; the university began as a 13th century monastic universe, which made women students - often resented - full members only in 1948. Even now, the walls of its glowing chambers are lined with the portraits of \"brilliant\" men, while its female academics argue that the puffed air of male superiority which hangs over the university encourages more men to top. Against this discussion, the power of seemingly simple words comes to light. Many words appear innocuous - think \"mankind\", \"forefathers\", \"housewife\" - but in fact, carry powerful implications, of the world being run by \"manpower\", women composing the frills, the cake-bakers, the eager nodders and not society's serious core. The weight of such words spills dangerously, impacting psyches negatively, inhibiting some, over-emboldening others. It is no wonder that words once used to describe physical conditions evolved. To call a \"wheelchair-user\" \"wheelchair-bound\" may sound the same- but there is a world of difference in those words, one implying helplessness, the other, agency. Of course, critics argue that being ultra-careful with our words is creating \"snowflakes\" - overly politically-correct individuals. But it?s better to be a snowflake than a bigot - go figure, genius.\n\n\n\r\n'.... genius comes naturally to men - and only occasionally to a few good women'.

Arrange those parts between A and B to give the correct sequence of the review.     A:\ufffd 'The Player-Avi Singh' is a terrifically entertaining sports saga, but is it a biopic, a \"biographical picture\"?     P:\ufffd Like many films about the famous. The Player-Avi Singh is a paradox. Without the cricketer's name, you would not have a \"biopic\". You'd just have the rags-to-riches story of some cricketer from a non descriptive town of India.     A bookstore would file the novelisation of the screenplay under \"Fiction: Underdog\". And yet, even with the player's name attached to the film, we get only the rousing high points of his career. There's not a whiff of even the most minor of infractions ? say, maintaining a slow over rate.     Q: We don't make good biopics in our country. For, we have to be very, very careful when it comes to what could be construed as defamation. A filmmaker wants a hit, not a lawsuit.     R: This isn't to say that a biopic has to be com- prehensive, giving us Avi's first walk, or the first words as he began to talk. But is it too much to expect that we get at least a sense of the man Avi was when he was not thinking about or playing cricket?     S:\ufffd Why not hint at this fact found on Wikipedia ? that his idols, as a child, were Amitabh Bachchan and Lata Mangeshkar. Also from     Wikipedia: \"But he also had a mischievous side to his personality. Once, while staying at the company quarters, Avi and a couple of his friends covered themselves in white bed-sheets and walked around in the complex late in the night. The night guards were fooled into believing that there were ghosts moving around in the complex.\" Could a few fours and sixes not have been sacrificed to give us this Avi?     B: Maybe biopics work best when they are about people we don't know very well. Maybe that is why our better biopics ? Shahid, Paan Singh Tomar ? are about people who lived far away from the limelight. Everything, thus, is a discovery.

In 1979, when Mother Teresa accepted the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo, she cancelled a celebratory banquet for 135 people and had the $7,000 it would have cost sent to her mission in Calcutta. The money would feed 400 people there for a full year. This was not unexpected coming from a nun who accepted the prize \"in the name of the hungry, naked, homeless, blind, lepers and all those who feel unwanted, unloved, uncared for throughout society\". When Pope Francis canonised her on September 4th he honoured a soldier of his flock, whose life exemplified the stated credo of his papacy: \"Dedication to the poorest of the poor\".     Today, Missionaries of Charity, Mother Teresa's order, has nearly 6,000 members and runs orphanages, hospices, homes for pregnant women and the mentally ill and other services in 139 countries. It would be misguided, however, to reduce the significance of Mother Teresa to her religious inspiration.

For those she and her Missionaries of     Charity cared for. Mother Teresa's theological concerns did not matter. She gave them dignity in the face of disease and death.

A comet, the size of a small mountain whizzed past Mars on 20th October, dazzling space enthusiasts with the once-in-a-million-years encounter.     The comet was discovered by Robert McNaught at Australia's Siding Spring Observatory in January 2013. Known as Siding Spring, the comet made its closest encounter with Mars at 2:27 pm (1827 GMT), racing past the Red Planet at a breakneck 126,000 miles (203,000kilometers) per hour.     Before the comet passed, it could be seen in space racing toward the brightly illuminated Red Planet, trailed by a cloud of debris. The comet is around one mile wide and is only about as solid as a pile of talcum powder. As it hurtled through space it created a meteor shower and shed debris mostly dust and pebbles - which scientists had feared could damage valuable spacecraft hovering Mars.     The comet has travelled more than one million years to take its first pass by Mars, and will not return for another million years, after it completes its next long loop around the sun.     Scientists said the comet's passing offered a unique chance to study its impact on Mars's atmosphere.

P: Twenty-something Pune-based Mimi Datta manages an upgrade on a long flight and finds herself seated next to a Rajib Vhora, he of piercing black eyes and a Rolex-adorned wrist. His smouldering good looks and fine manners bewitch her immediately. By a very lucky coincidence, Mimi happens to be the photographer at the wedding of Vhora's sister. Sparks fly, inevitably, as we know they should. Every cliche idea of romance that has found its way into the Bollywood of old, leaps off the pages here.     Q: In reality, the book seems like it's been copied from one of Karan Johar's overly frothy family dramas in which the happy Hindu family is unabashedly celebrated. There is an inebriated nani, a handsome, brooding tycoon and a good looking journalist who's begun to moonlight as an event photographer to supplement her meagre income.

S:\ufffd The book is misleading from the start. The first few pages lead us to believe that we'd gain a little insight into the surreal world of temporary make-belief of an Indian wedding.

The coverage of Kabali by the newspapers in India has attracted a vortex of complaints from their readers.     Some went on to say that the reportage on Kabali reflected the fall in the standard of the newspapers. In some opinion the focus and hype created by the newspapers also reflect the fall in their standard of reporting.     Another reader was of the firm opinion that the media hype surrounding the film would have a debilitating influence on schoolchildren.     A newspaper is a form of common good. The plurality and multiplicity of issues it covers gives it a social role.     While politics, international relations, security affairs, economics, and policy debates are seen as topics that have a public interest component, many fail to understand the multiple strands that make up our cultural fabric. There seems to be a hierarchy where high culture, especially classical forms, is accorded respectability and its reportage is seen as worthy news.     However, when it comes to popular culture, the opinion is divided. Nearly two decades ago, Ashis Nandy, one of the finest intellectuals, argued that popular Indian cinema offers a \"slum's eye view of politics.\" He explained how it recreated a remembered village in more than one sense. Mr. Nandy recorded how the screen becomes the site for modernising India in all its complexity, sophistry,     naivete, and at times even vulgarity, where a dialogue between tradition and modernity is taking place. Hence, it becomes an editorial obligation to look at a phenomenon like Kabali which generated not just nationwide interest but became an international curiosity too. The news about Kabali was one of the biggest entertainment news in most of the South-East Asian countries and in Anglophone countries in Africa. If a particular popular cultural moment has captured the imagination of the people, can the newspaper afford not to cover it extensively? I would have been appalled if any of the major developments had been neglected by the newspaper to accommodate stories about Kabali. But this was the period when the paper had extensive coverage of not only domestic politics, economics and social issues, but also international developments including Brexit, Donald Trump's candidature, the botched up coup in Turkey and its bloody fallout, and terror attacks in Nice and Munich.

The movie is a supercharged cross-border drama that goes all out in delivering its message of sub continental peace. Director pulls out an old chestnut - the theme of humanity trumping a history of bitterness.     P: The hero does not lie, offer Namaz five times a day, and is under oath to Allah to find Samira's parents. The man puts everything at stake, driven by his faith in Allah, to ensure that the lost girl makes it back home in one piece. When he tunnels his way into Nepal, Rehan runs into a battery of security agents and cops determined to bring the \"Indian spy\" to book.In his uphill task, he is aided by ordinary folk in Nepal - a journo, a priest and even a bus conductor who is so impressed with Rehan's selfless mission that he saves him when the cops came calling.     Q: Watch the movie even if you aren't an inveterate Rehan's fan. Samira will steal your heart. Rehan may be the principal driving force of the movie, but the real star of the film is the super-cute child actor .Her winning smile, her large, playful eyes and a face can melt the toughest heart, even that of a dyed in the wool film critic.     R: Into this perennially bubbling cauldron, he throws a devout, upright Muslim do-gooder and an achingly beatific but speechless six-year-old Nepali girl, who is a Hindu, stranded on the Indian side of the border. Bridging many divides - religion, national identity, food habits -the two develop an unlikely bond that wipes out all prejudices.     S: From the perspective of Rehan's core constituency, the movie might seem a touch tame. The blustery superstar goes missing in the movie as do his signature punch lines. It is, clearly, a calculated risk, a bid to reinvent a successful screen persona that might have outlived its utility in the light of the ageing actor's off-screen troubles.

For example, take the dream growth rate of 10%.

In the social sciences and humanities, there are a small number of respectable departments, but absolutely none that are considered by international experts as in the top class of academic programmes.     Q: Not only are overseas programmes and departments more prestigious, they also have far better facilities, laboratories and a more favourable culture of research. Top faculty members are often more accessible and it is easier to become affiliated with a laboratory or institute.     R: Post-graduate students from India are increasingly choosing to study abroad.

Rich Arab countries such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar supported different rebel groups against the regime because they wanted President Bashar al-Assad, an ally of Iran, to be toppled. Turkey, driven by its regional ambitions, also threw its weight behind the rebels and kept open its long border, through which fighters could cross into Syria to join the war.

P: Violence and atrocities against Dalits cannot be linked to any party or government. More than a law and order issue, such violence is a social phenomenon. How can anyone, who has a sense of nationalism and patriotism, discriminate on the basis of caste? Such problems have existed in other societies as well but they were remedied in modern times. India has fared poorly compared to the West in this respect. Why didn't India have upper caste heroes like the abolitionists in the US such as Abraham Lincoln and John Brown? Lincoln had to pay the price for liberating blacks with his life. Today the African-American community in the US has illustrious figures like President Barack Obama, and Oprah Winfrey.     Q: Furthermore, several loopholes in our legal system ensured that a vast majority of crimes against Dalits went unpunished. The perpetrators of such acts know that the poor and Dalits cannot hire expensive lawyers. So they do not think twice before inflicting violence on them; they also have the support of many people from their caste. Normally, the state should not interfere in social and cultural matters, but India needs major social reforms -even revolution.     R: The lynching of Dalits in Una, Dayashankar Singh's statement on Mayawati and several other abominable acts against Dalits are testimonies to how society treats them. In Una, Dalits were beaten up for skinning a dead cow ? they had not killed the animal in question. There was a similar incident In Haryana's Jhajjar district in October 2002. Five Dalits, who were rumoured to have killed a cow, were beaten to death. But they had merely skinned the dead animal. Such violence stems from a mind-set that holds Dalits as inferior.     S:\ufffd Perpetrators of violence against Dalits ? like those in Una and Jhajjar - do not know how much they have harmed themselves and society. In a discriminatory society, no one prospers and is happy.

Recently, there has been a lot of emphasis on the fink- ages between agriculture and nutrition, which can be improved by three entry points. The first of these is in ensuring inclusiveness and equity in agriculture that can be achieved by increasing agricultural productivity in rain fed and resource-poor areas. This in turn will help raise the productivity and income of small and marginal farmers. The bulk of the rural poor, as well as small and marginal farmers, live in such resource-poor areas, where under-nutrition is largely prevalent. The second is in policies to diversify diet in order to improve micro-nutrients and the third is in having agricultural policies to empower women. In all this, it must not be forgotten that climate change poses a major challenge to agriculture.     This year is the International Year of Family Farming; it needs to be noted that Dr. M.S. Swaminathan has often mentioned the importance of family farming in offering an effective and an economic solution to ensuring that every person has access to nutritious food. Biofortification is one way of having access to micronutrients. According to Prof. Swaminathan, we should also help promote naturally biofortified crops such as sweet potato,moringa (drumsticks), bread fruit and various berries which are rich in micronutrients such as iron, zinc, vitamin A and vitamin C.     The importance of sanitation and safe drinking water in reducing malnutrition is well known. Therefore, ensuring improvements in sanitation is urgently needed as it is a big predictor of malnutrition.     It is heartening to see that social protection programmes have helped in improving nutrition. Further, the strengthening of social protection programmes like ICDS, PDS, mid-day meal schemes and MGNREGA are needed to achieve nutrition security. Although delivery systems have improved in programmes like PDS, the leakages are still high.     The consequences of under-nutrition are well known. Stunting and under-nutrition are the main contributing factors for child mortality, disability and disease. There are also the harmful effects of an inadequate intake of specific micronutrients essential for brain development and the nervous system. For example, iron deficiency is known to affect a child's performance in school. In short, \"hidden hunger\" has to be reduced.     In conclusion, it has to be recognised that ignoring hunger and malnutrition will have significant costs to any country's development. Nutrition improvement has both intrinsic and instrumental value. Some estimates indicate that there is a 2 to 3 per cent GDP loss due to low productivity. The returns to investments in food and nutrition are quite high. Every dollar spent on intervenetions to reduce stunting is estimated to generate about 30 in economic returns. The government should understand the intrinsic value to people and instrumental value of nutrition in terms of GDP gain and returns to investment. Therefore, some urgency needs to be shown by the government and others concerned in order to eliminate hunger and malnutrition particularly among children and women.

Among Hindus, Scheduled Tribes, Scheduled Castes and then OBCs have lower access to toilets. A similar pattern exists for the actual use of toilets among religious groups.     Q: However, researchers Diane Coffey, Aashish Gupta et al of the Research Institute for Compassionate Economics (RICE) found that 7 per cent of households with access to a toilet were not using them. When they looked at households where at least one family member was not using the toilet, the number swelled to 18 per cent.

He staged a walkout from the Assembly after replies by the Bharatiya Janata Party government failed to convince him. A few weeks ago, he published Vyapamgate, a 100-page detailed summary of the scam\n\n\nR: Mr. Saklecha's struggle is largely inspired by his love for teaching and empathy for underprivileged students.

Would it bring elusive homes within the reach of the urban poor? The answer is not a convincing yes. The report has many useful suggestions on the financial aspects, but it inadequately addresses supply issues. It rightly points out that many existing schemes have barriers that prevent the poor from benefiting. For instance, the Affordable_ Housing in Partnership Scheme, launched four years ago to produce one million houses, has so far delivered only 5776. Though the scheme provides a subsidy of Rs. 50, 000 per dwelling unit, the government spends only Rs. 26, 000. This is due to an unreasonable condition ? that the subsidy no: exceeds 25 per cent of the amount spent on providing services such as water supply. The task force wants the government to fine tune the scheme and increase the subsidy to Rs. 100,000.

P: Set some time aside each day to work on your project. Forward progress is what counts and it provides the positive feedback to keep you going.

If you stay away from working on a project for too long of a time, it gets harder and harder to get back to it.     Q: Have a picture in your mind and a vision of what the product will look like and the feelings you will have when it is complete. Break the project into manageable tasks.

Goals are dreams with deadlines. If you don't have a deadline to get your product to market, you are just daydreaming. Get started.

As Bianca and then Selah are taken away from him, Thaddeus becomes the main figure in the war against February.     Q:The scenes of organized revolt form a reasonably coherent narrative, but things are complicated by the interspersing of snippets of February?s life in his cottage in the woods. These scenes make February?s relationship with the town rather ambiguous and, as a result, it is difficult to attempt any sort of unifiled reading of the novel. Is this a story about rebellion? A story about narrative/ A story about depression? It lends itself to all of these theories and more, and then flits away at the last moment.     R: February has taken over the town. February is eternal winter. February is a god figure in the sky. February is a man who writes in a house in the woods. Whatever he is, February is destructive and must be fought.     S: Light Boxes begins with February's ban on flight. He sends his priests into the town to burn hot air balloons and paper aero planes, and to destroy anything else that flies. Thaddeus Lowe, a former balloonist, and his wife Selah and daughter Bianca revolt against these conditions. They paint balloons in hidden corners, and kites all the way up Bianca's arms.

This is my fourth time in Kolkata. I first came as a four-year-old tourist. Some of those memories remain. Of relaxing on the lawns at Science City, settled on a low branch of a wayside tree having poha that my mom fed me; of walking along the white walls of the Birla Planetarium, eating something I did not like at a very crowded and dirty corner near a red building... Photographs had been clicked in abundance. Calcutta had charmed me from a young age, though very little of the adoration survived the metamorphosis I underwent since then. I grew up to be a Political Science student in love with literature. Surfing through that untouched section in the college library that housed torn books with brown pages, something caught my attention. The City of Joy by Dominique Lapierre. The City of Joy must have been the first book of its kind that I read. Needless to say, the book became a constant companion from the moment I began reading it. It was the tale of a family of farmers in a village in Bengal that, impoverished by the wrath of nature, had shifted base to Calcutta. The family represented lakhs of others who had left behind their home and hearth and come to the city in the hope of being able to feed their children. The book took my hand and led me to Calcutta. I spent sleep- less winter nights with the family on the Howrah bridge, which had become home for the dispossessed migrants. I walked with Hasari Pal as he hunted for a job. I bled with him when he, starving for days, donated his blood for money. I ran with him when he pulled his rickshaw. I sat silent with Hasari when, one by one, his comrades fell, spitting blood and dying because of what was called Red Fever. I wept with Father Stephen Kovalski who had come to the city to serve the poorest of the poor. The book had taken me deep into the heart of Calcutta. And by the time I finished reading it, my imagination had blown up with the Calcutta that I had woven out from Dominique Lapierre's depiction. And that was my second time in Calcutta. The Presidency College in Calcutta is an institute associated with the names of many luminaries, such as, Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose etc. One day in January some years back I got the surprise of my life when I received an e-mail informing me of my selection for the undergraduate associate ship programme of the college. I had applied a few months earlier, and forgotten all about it. The summer was at its peak. It was a hot gust of wind that first welcomed me to the city. Deep within, I was full of smiles. I was here again, borne by the soil, breathing the air and sheltered by the sky of Calcutta. For a month and a half I devoured every moment spent here. A visit to the Birla Planetarium brought back images of the four- year-old sitting on those steps. The St.Paul?s Cathedral looked exactly as in the Photograph. The metro, the tram, the yellow taxi and the rickshaw, everything was as I had heard. I walked across the Howrah Bridge, where Hasari's children had slept, starving and shivering. I saw a couple of the old-time rickshaws that had taken the lives of Hasari's friends. I witnessed Kolkata's reverence for Ma Kali a number of times. At Gariahat there will be one framed photograph per stall, or one shared by many. Every man, mind you, every man, begins his first sale for the day by first offering the item being sold to Ma. Facing the photo, he shuts his eyes and takes the /tern near his forehead and bows in front of her. He does the same to the first currency note he earns for the day. If this is how they adore their Ma on a routine day, I can only wonder how the city would look during Durga Puja. This city has immortalised Rabindranath Tagore. On calm breezy evenings, the soft Rabindra Sangeeth flowing out of the corners in the Victoria Memorial Park, soothes your heart in ways that cannot be fully explained. Kolkata kept me truly happy. I was alone and independent and that gave me a glimpse of who I actually am. That was a big step towards the moulding of the living, thinking being in me. That was the third time. Now, I am here for the last time in this story. I left Kolkata when it was burning hot, and now isn't it a sight to see her shiver! Everything else is the same. Only the laziness has taken on a higher degree with the dipping Celsius. Time is running out. After my fourth time, I have begun the countdown to the return journey. So what? Wherever I am, the lessons of Political Science, of life, of beauty and Independence you, Kolkata, have taught me will forever radiate out of my persona. Something tells me, you will beckon again. Again and again. You will tap me on my shoulders, and as I turn back,\ufffd you will pull me into your lap and smile at me as I fall onto it. You will come in my dreams and ask me why I am away. You will send reminders all around the world, wherever I am. You will tempt me with your charm, and even without your call, I will find myself coming towards you.

P: This is Andersen's first major final. Coming into US Open, his best Grand Slam result was at the quarter-finals of the 2015 US Open, where he defeated Andy Murray, but ended up losing to Stan Wawrinka. On Sunday, he was completely overwhelmed by Nadal, who he has known since he was a child. \"It feels like I have been watching you play all my life,\" Anderson said. Q: He is second to only No. 3 Roger Federer, who has 19 Grand Slam titles. Nadal will now have an almost 2000-point lead that will further cement his position at the top of the rankings. At this tournament, Nadal missed playing Federer, who lost to No. 24 seed Juan Martin del Potro in the quarter- finals. Nadal didn't face an opponent in the top 20 in his run to the title. R: Nadal dominated every aspect of the match that lasted around two and a half hours. Anderson was able to serve aces - his biggest strength - under extreme pressure, but it was no match to Nadal?s superior forehand and a ferocious backhand. Nadal managed to break Anderson four times in the game - all that was needed to take the match in straight sets. S: In what was yet another clinical performance, World No. 1 Rafael Nadal defeated No. 28 Kevin Anderson 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 to lift his third US Open title and his 16th overall Grand Slam title.

P: Violence and atrocities against Dalits cannot be linked to any party or government. More than a law and order issue, such violence is a social phenomenon. How can anyone, who has a sense of nationalism and patriotism, discriminate on the basis of caste? Such problems have existed in other societies as well but they were remedied in modern times. India has fared poorly compared to the West in this respect. Why didn't India have upper caste heroes like the abolitionists in the US such as Abraham Lincoln and John Brown? Lincoln had to pay the price for liberating blacks with his life. Today the African-American community in the US has illustrious figures like President Barack Obama, and Oprah Winfrey.     Q: Furthermore, several loopholes in our legal system ensured that a vast majority of crimes against Dalits went unpunished. The perpetrators of such acts know that the poor and Dalits cannot hire expensive lawyers. So they do not think twice before inflicting violence on them; they also have the support of many people from their caste. Normally, the state should not interfere in social and cultural matters, but India needs major social reforms -even revolution.     R: The lynching of Dalits in Una, Dayashankar Singh's statement on Mayawati and several other abominable acts against Dalits are testimonies to how society treats them. In Una, Dalits were beaten up for skinning a dead cow ? they had not killed the animal in question. There was a similar incident In Haryana's Jhajjar district in October 2002. Five Dalits, who were rumoured to have killed a cow, were beaten to death. But they had merely skinned the dead animal. Such violence stems from a mind-set that holds Dalits as inferior.     S:\ufffd Perpetrators of violence against Dalits ? like those in Una and Jhajjar - do not know how much they have harmed themselves and society. In a discriminatory society, no one prospers and is happy. Research, science and technology, production, healthy politics, arts and culture cannot evolve in such a society, and mere government efforts are insufficient to create a developed country.", "Option A": "RSQP", "Option B": "RQPS", "Option C": "QRSP", "Option D": "PSRQ", "Option E": "None of these", "Solution": "B"}, {"Question": "Change the voice.

Recently, there has been a lot of emphasis on the fink- ages between agriculture and nutrition, which can be improved by three entry points. The first of these is in ensuring inclusiveness and equity in agriculture that can be achieved by increasing agricultural productivity in rain fed and resource-poor areas. This in turn will help raise the productivity and income of small and marginal farmers. The bulk of the rural poor, as well as small and marginal farmers, live in such resource-poor areas, where under-nutrition is largely prevalent. The second is in policies to diversify diet in order to improve micro-nutrients and the third is in having agricultural policies to empower women. In all this, it must not be forgotten that climate change poses a major challenge to agriculture.     This year is the International Year of Family Farming; it needs to be noted that Dr. M.S. Swaminathan has often mentioned the importance of family farming in offering an effective and an economic solution to ensuring that every person has access to nutritious food. Biofortification is one way of having access to micronutrients. According to Prof. Swaminathan, we should also help promote naturally biofortified crops such as sweet potato,moringa (drumsticks), bread fruit and various berries which are rich in micronutrients such as iron, zinc, vitamin A and vitamin C.     The importance of sanitation and safe drinking water in reducing malnutrition is well known. Therefore, ensuring improvements in sanitation is urgently needed as it is a big predictor of malnutrition.     It is heartening to see that social protection programmes have helped in improving nutrition. Further, the strengthening of social protection programmes like ICDS, PDS, mid-day meal schemes and MGNREGA are needed to achieve nutrition security. Although delivery systems have improved in programmes like PDS, the leakages are still high.     The consequences of under-nutrition are well known. Stunting and under-nutrition are the main contributing factors for child mortality, disability and disease. There are also the harmful effects of an inadequate intake of specific micronutrients essential for brain development and the nervous system. For example, iron deficiency is known to affect a child's performance in school. In short, \"hidden hunger\" has to be reduced.     In conclusion, it has to be recognised that ignoring hunger and malnutrition will have significant costs to any country's development. Nutrition improvement has both intrinsic and instrumental value. Some estimates indicate that there is a 2 to 3 per cent GDP loss due to low productivity. The returns to investments in food and nutrition are quite high. Every dollar spent on intervenetions to reduce stunting is estimated to generate about 30 in economic returns. The government should understand the intrinsic value to people and instrumental value of nutrition in terms of GDP gain and returns to investment. Therefore, some urgency needs to be shown by the government and others concerned in order to eliminate hunger and malnutrition particularly among children and women.

P:\ufffd Both access to toilets, and the actual use of the toilet, lags among Hindu households. The figure for households without toilets is 47 per cent for Hindu households as against 31 percent for Muslims and 16 per cent for Christians and Sikhs, N5S data shows. Among Hindus, Scheduled Tribes, Scheduled Castes and then OBCs have lower access to toilets. A similar pattern exists for the actual use of toilets among religious groups.     Q: However, researchers Diane Coffey, Aashish Gupta et al of the Research Institute for Compassionate Economics (RICE) found that 7 per cent of households with access to a toilet were not using them. When they looked at households where at least one family member was not using the toilet, the number swelled to 18 per cent. This number is being driven up by men, who, in all three surveys, reported lower toilet use than women.     R: Not having a toilet remains the major problem in sanitation: 60 per cent of rural households and fewer than 10 per cent of urban households in India do not have access to a toilet, according to new official data from the 68th round of the National Sample Survey (NSS) data. But even among households with access to toilets, some open defecation exists. According to NSS data, two per cent of rural households with access to toilets do not use them.

If 1,400 years later, we have to shoot girls in the head in an attempt to shut them up, someone like Bertrand Russell might say we haven't made much progress.\n\n\n\n\nIt has also been suggested that your letter represents the mainstream opinion in Pakistan. But don't fall for this praise. You might think that a lot of people support your just fight, but there is a part of them that worries whether their girl will get the grades to get into to a good university.\n\n\n\n\nDon't believe me? You may have seen the propaganda pictures of female pilots released by your former employer, Pakistan's air force. Some of them have started to fly fighter aircraft. Like you, I'm of the firm belief no good has ever come out of the Pakistani army's misadventures. But just think of the day when one of those female pilots decides to not leave it to Allah.\n\n\n\n\nWhy author thinks that Bertrand Russell might say that the human race has not made much progress?", "Option A": "Because women are still shot for voicing their opinions", "Option B": "Because Talibans shot Malala Yousafzai", "Option C": "Because of jahilia", "Option D": "Because world is yet to understand that the pen is mightier than sword", "Option E": "None of these", "Solution": "A"}, {"Question": "Direction: Given below is the body of a letter.\n\n\n\n\nRead this carefully and answer the questions that follow.\n\n\n\n\nI am writing to you in my personal capacity. This may not be the opinion of the people of Pakistan or the policy of the government, but I write to thank you in response to the generous letter you have written to Malala Yousafzai. Thanks for owning up that your comrades tried to kill her by shooting her in the head. Many of your well-wishers in Pakistan had been claiming that Taliban wouldn't attack a minor girl. They were of the opinion that Malala had shot herself in order to become a celebrity and get a UK visa. Women, as we know, will go to any lengths to get what they want. So thanks for saying that a 14-year-old girl was the Tali ban's foe. And if she rolls out the old cliche that the pen is mightier than sword, she must face the sword and find it for herself.\n\n\n\n\nLike you, there are others who are still not sure whether it was \"Islamically correct or wrong\", or whether she deserved to be \"killed or not\", but then you go on to suggest that we leave it to Allah. There are a lot of people in Pakistan, some of them not even Muslims, who, when faced with difficult choices or everyday hardships, say let's leave it to Allah. Sometimes it's the only solace for the helpless. But most people don't say leave it to Allah after shooting a kid in the face.\n\n\n\n\nAllow me to make another small theological point -again about girls. Before the advent of Islam, before the Prophet gave us the holy book that you want Malala to learn again, in the times we call Jahilia, people used to bury their newborn daughters. They probably found them annoying and thought it better to get rid of them before they learned to speak. We are told Islam came to put an end to such horrendous practices.

Q: Have a picture in your mind and a vision of what the product will look like and the feelings you will have when it is complete. Break the project into manageable tasks. It's easy to get overwhelmed if you are starting from scratch. This will help you avoid procrastination, and give you positive feedback at the end of each step. The size of the tasks will depend on your working style and the size of the available time slots.     R: Deadlines are important, even if you have to modify them as the project progresses. Goals are dreams with deadlines. If you don't have a deadline to get your product to market, you are just daydreaming. Get started. One of my favourite quotes is from Goethe - 'Whatever you can do or dream you can, begin it; bold-ness has genius, power and magic in it.     S: Determine the scope of the project. The first and foremost step is to form the determination what you want to accomplish. What are the limits within which you will develop your product? There are two things which must be taken care of: Who is your audience and what would you like them to do after they view or listen to this program?

The smooth flowing narration makes it a delight to watch as you get involved with the Dutta family from the word go.     \ufffdS: His daughter Reena's life willy nilly revolves around her father's toilet rituals, thus affecting her career, her moods, and also thwarting any chances of her meeting a decent man to marry.

At the end of Narendra Modi's first year in government, a verdict on his performance would read something like this: He has done better than UPA-11, but he has under-delivered on the promise that brought him to power in May 2014 ?the promise of bringing a radically refreshing approach to governance and business. To be sure, the economy is reviving, but business confidence, while still positive, is now more muted than it was last year. There is also a sense that luck (especially falling oil prices) helped improve the economy's performance on growth, inflation, and the twin deficits (fiscal and current account), but the government has not shown enough pluck or the gumption needed to harness favourable winds to put the economy on a much higher trajectory. Luck without pluck is not a combination that can sustain. And incremental change?a little tweak here and a push in the right direction there?is not going to move the\ufffd economy to double-digit growth any time soon. It would be churlish to deny the government some of its obvious successes. The bill to increase foreign direct investment in insurance is law; so are the coal and mining and minerals amendments bills. The spectrum auctions have been a big hit, and the first phase of the coal mine auctions brought in big revenues for states with this mineral in sackfuls. Diesel prices have been decontrolled, and cooking gas subsidies are now paid directly into bank accounts (thanks to the speedy expansion of the Jan-Dhan inclusive banking scheme and the Aadhaar unique ID rollout). Two minor labour reform bills?one to exempt establishments with fewer than 40 employees from furnishing returns and maintaining registers, and the Apprentices Bill, to make it easier for factories to take on trainees?have also passed their respective legislative hurdles.

Penguin picked it up, and gave it a wider release earlier this year.     P: After an abortive attempt to fly a kite in defiance of February's orders. Thaddeus is approached by a group calling themselves ?The solution?. They wear plastic bird masks to remind them of what they have lost. They are organizing a revolution. As Bianca and then Selah are taken away from him, Thaddeus becomes the main figure in the war against February.     Q:The scenes of organized revolt form a reasonably coherent narrative, but things are complicated by the interspersing of snippets of February?s life in his cottage in the woods. These scenes make February?s relationship with the town rather ambiguous and, as a result, it is difficult to attempt any sort of unifiled reading of the novel. Is this a story about rebellion? A story about narrative/ A story about depression? It lends itself to all of these theories and more, and then flits away at the last moment.     R: February has taken over the town. February is eternal winter. February is a god figure in the sky. February is a man who writes in a house in the woods. Whatever he is, February is destructive and must be fought.     S: Light Boxes begins with February's ban on flight. He sends his priests into the town to burn hot air balloons and paper aero planes, and to destroy anything else that flies. Thaddeus Lowe, a former balloonist, and his wife Selah and daughter Bianca revolt against these conditions. They paint balloons in hidden corners, and kites all the way up Bianca's arms.

This is my fourth time in Kolkata. I first came as a four-year-old tourist. Some of those memories remain. Of relaxing on the lawns at Science City, settled on a low branch of a wayside tree having poha that my mom fed me; of walking along the white walls of the Birla Planetarium, eating something I did not like at a very crowded and dirty corner near a red building... Photographs had been clicked in abundance. Calcutta had charmed me from a young age, though very little of the adoration survived the metamorphosis I underwent since then. I grew up to be a Political Science student in love with literature. Surfing through that untouched section in the college library that housed torn books with brown pages, something caught my attention. The City of Joy by Dominique Lapierre. The City of Joy must have been the first book of its kind that I read. Needless to say, the book became a constant companion from the moment I began reading it. It was the tale of a family of farmers in a village in Bengal that, impoverished by the wrath of nature, had shifted base to Calcutta. The family represented lakhs of others who had left behind their home and hearth and come to the city in the hope of being able to feed their children. The book took my hand and led me to Calcutta. I spent sleep- less winter nights with the family on the Howrah bridge, which had become home for the dispossessed migrants. I walked with Hasari Pal as he hunted for a job. I bled with him when he, starving for days, donated his blood for money. I ran with him when he pulled his rickshaw. I sat silent with Hasari when, one by one, his comrades fell, spitting blood and dying because of what was called Red Fever. I wept with Father Stephen Kovalski who had come to the city to serve the poorest of the poor. The book had taken me deep into the heart of Calcutta. And by the time I finished reading it, my imagination had blown up with the Calcutta that I had woven out from Dominique Lapierre's depiction. And that was my second time in Calcutta. The Presidency College in Calcutta is an institute associated with the names of many luminaries, such as, Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose etc. One day in January some years back I got the surprise of my life when I received an e-mail informing me of my selection for the undergraduate associate ship programme of the college. I had applied a few months earlier, and forgotten all about it. The summer was at its peak. It was a hot gust of wind that first welcomed me to the city. Deep within, I was full of smiles. I was here again, borne by the soil, breathing the air and sheltered by the sky of Calcutta. For a month and a half I devoured every moment spent here. A visit to the Birla Planetarium brought back images of the four- year-old sitting on those steps. The St.Paul?s Cathedral looked exactly as in the Photograph. The metro, the tram, the yellow taxi and the rickshaw, everything was as I had heard. I walked across the Howrah Bridge, where Hasari's children had slept, starving and shivering. I saw a couple of the old-time rickshaws that had taken the lives of Hasari's friends. I witnessed Kolkata's reverence for Ma Kali a number of times. At Gariahat there will be one framed photograph per stall, or one shared by many. Every man, mind you, every man, begins his first sale for the day by first offering the item being sold to Ma. Facing the photo, he shuts his eyes and takes the /tern near his forehead and bows in front of her. He does the same to the first currency note he earns for the day. If this is how they adore their Ma on a routine day, I can only wonder how the city would look during Durga Puja. This city has immortalised Rabindranath Tagore. On calm breezy evenings, the soft Rabindra Sangeeth flowing out of the corners in the Victoria Memorial Park, soothes your heart in ways that cannot be fully explained. Kolkata kept me truly happy. I was alone and independent and that gave me a glimpse of who I actually am. That was a big step towards the moulding of the living, thinking being in me. That was the third time. Now, I am here for the last time in this story. I left Kolkata when it was burning hot, and now isn't it a sight to see her shiver! Everything else is the same. Only the laziness has taken on a higher degree with the dipping Celsius. Time is running out. After my fourth time, I have begun the countdown to the return journey. So what? Wherever I am, the lessons of Political Science, of life, of beauty and Independence you, Kolkata, have taught me will forever radiate out of my persona. Something tells me, you will beckon again. Again and again. You will tap me on my shoulders, and as I turn back,\ufffd you will pull me into your lap and smile at me as I fall onto it. You will come in my dreams and ask me why I am away. You will send reminders all around the world, wherever I am. You will tempt me with your charm, and even without your call, I will find myself coming towards you.
